# Select a deployment name to be unique, not to have collisions when multiple pushes/builds occur of the same Git branch.
# We use the git commit hash. BUT, a k8s deployment MUST start with a letter, so we prepend with `azk`.
# The release also needs to be short enough so other k8s resources can prepend the release name and still be under
# 63 characters, so we just take the first 10 chars of the git hash.
