  description: >-
    Allows multiple organisations to carry out private record linkage -
    without disclosing personally identifiable information.

    In general:

    * All parameters and returned objects are JSON with content-type set to
    `"application/json"`.

    * All authentication tokens are 48 character hex strings.

    * The `Project`/`Run` resource identifiers are also 48 char hex strings.

    * HTTP status codes are used to distinguish server outcomes.


    **Note:** Several important concepts including security considerations are described in
    [separate documentation](./concepts.html).

    ### Introduction

    This is a service that computes matches of entity records between two parties.
    The personally identifiable information used for linking is first locally transformed
    to anonymous linking codes called [Cryptographic Longterm Keys](concepts.html#cryptographic-longterm-key)
    (CLKs). Each party then uploads its CLKs to the service for matching.
    The service supports three different [types of outputs](concepts.html#result-types)
    of matching results, varying in privacy properties.
    For the CLKs to be comparable, the parties need to agree on and follow a particular
    [linkage schema](concepts.html#schema) and agree on a shared secret before generating
    and uploading the CLKs.


    ### Security

    See the linked [security documentation](./security.html).


    __Warning__: There are no restrictions on accessing the service, i.e., everyone can call the different endpoints.
    However, authorization is required to access sensitive data. The authorization is described [here](security.html#auth).


    Most endpoints require an authorization header to be sent along with any request.


    ### Generating CLKs

    See the [anonlink-client](https://github.com/data61/anonlink-client) project for details and a command line
    tool to locally generate CLKs from entity data to upload.



    ## Matching Protocols

    The Entity Service supports three different **result types** with varying privacy properties which define the produced result,
    and who may see the which part of the output.

    See the documentation section on [output types](./concepts.html#result-types).

    The options are:

      * `"permutations"` - Creates random permutations and a mask.
      * `"similarity_scores"` - Outputs a list of similarity scores of `[indexA, indexB, score]`, where `score`
        represents the likelihood that `indexA = indexB`.
      * `"groups"` - Outputs a list of groups of records, where each group represents one entity.

    Only `"groups"` supports multi-party linkage. `"permutations"` and `"similarity_scores"` only support linkage
    with two parties.

        Provides the caller with credentials that will be required for any further
        interaction with this project.

        ### Schema

        Although these comprise the column names, the raw data will never be
        sent to this entity service.

        Each participant will be able to see the schema to verify it is
        what they expect. Schema details should have been determined and agreed
        on by each party before starting a mapping task. This is documented
        in [schema](./concepts.html#schema).

        ### Result Type

        The result type specifies what information is available after the entity
        resolving process has completed. All project **runs** will use this result type.

        The parts of the computed linkage results that are accessable by the different tokens depends on the
        `result_type`:

        - `"similarity_scores"`, or `"groups"`\
        If the `result_type` is `"similarity_scores"` or `"groups"` then the results can be accessed with the
        `result_token``token`, which is provided when initially creating the mapping.

        - `"permutations"`\
        If the `result_type` is `permutations`, then the data providers can access their respective permutation with
        their individual `receipt_token`, which they obtain when adding data to the mapping.
        The mask can be accessed with the `result_token`.

        Only `"groups"` supports multi-party linkage. If the result type is `"similarity_scores"` or
        `"permutations"`, then the number of parties must be 2.

        A valid **upload token** is required to authorise this call. The returned *Temporary Object
        Store Credentials* can be used with any S3 compatible client. For example by using `boto3` in
        Python. The returned credentials are restricted to allow only uploading data to a particular path 
        in a particular bucket for a finite period (defaulting to 12 hours).

        Note this feature may be disabled by the administrator, in this case the endpoint will return a
        `500` server error.

      summary: Upload encoded data to a linkage project.
      tags:
        - Project
      description: |
        Called by each data provider with their encodings and optional blocking
        information.

        The caller must have both the `project_id` and a valid `upload_token` in order to contribute data,
        both of these are generated when a project is created.
        This endpoint can directly accept uploads up to several hundred MiB, and can pull encoding data from
        an object store for larger uploads.

        The data uploaded must be of one of the following formats:

        - Encodings only: An array of base64 encoded [CLKs](./concepts.html#cryptographic-longterm-keys), one per
          entity.
        - CLKs with blocking information upload: An array of base64 encoded CLKs with corresponding blocking
          information. One element in this array is an array with the first element being a base64 encoded CLK followed
          by the block IDs the CLK corresponds to.

        When the last party successfully uploads their data any existing project runs are queued
        for execution.

        The uploaded encodings must all have the same length in bytes. If the project's linkage schema
        specifes an encoding size it will be checked and enforced before any runs are computed. Note a
        minimum and maximum encoding size can be set at the server level at deployment time.
        Currently anonlink requires this _encoding size_ to be a multiple of 8. A common value is `128 Bytes`.

        Note in the default deployment the maximum request size is set to `~10 GB`, which __should__
        translate to just over 20 million entities.

        ### JSON Upload

        This endpoint can be used with the Content-Type: application/json and uses the `CLKUpload`
        structure of a JSON array of base64 encoded strings.

        ### Object Store Upload

        `encodings` and `blocks` can be pulled from an object store. `encodings` must be in the binary format
        documented under the `/projects/{project_id}/binaryclks` endpoint. `blocks` must be a JSON file, comprising
        a mapping of encoding identifiers to a list of block identifiers; both identifiers must be strings.

        ### Binary Upload

        An additional api endpoint (/projects/{project_id}/binaryclks) has been added for uploading CLKs as a binary
        file. This is to allow for faster and more efficient data transfer.

        Additional headers are required:

          Content-Type: application/octet-stream
          Hash-Count: <number of CLKS>
          Hash-Size: <size of one CLK in bytes>

        The file is a series of CLK data:

            bit_packing_fmt = "!<Hash-Size>s"

        Where:

            "!" Use network byte order (big-endian).
            "<Hash-Size>s" Store the 128 raw bytes of the bitarray. Default value is "128s".

        ## Response

        The response schema depends on the mapping's `result_type`. OpenAPI doesn't
        allow different schemas (in v2) so these are documented here:

        Note if the result isn't ready, a `404` will be returned.


        ### result_type = "similarity_scores"

        Similarity scores can be retrieved as `JSON` (the default), or a direct link
        to the binary file stored in an object store.

        #### JSON

        The list of the pairwise similarity scores where the score
        is greater than the similarity threshold.
        Data is returned as `json` object e.g.,

            {
                "similarity_scores":
                    [
                        [[0, 5], [1, 27], 1.0],
                        [[1, 10], [0, 14], 1.0]
                    ]
            }


        The element in the list is a list of three elements of the following format
        `[[party_id_0, row_index_0], [party_id_1, row_index_1], score]`, where `[party_id_0, row_index_0]`
        refers to the record at the index `row_index_0` from the dataset `party_id_0`, similarly for
        `[party_id_1, row_index_1]`, and `score` is the similarity score representing the likelihood
        that this pair or records is a match.

        `ds_index_0`, `rec_index_0, `ds_index_1` and `rec_index_1` start from 0, and `party_id_0 != party_id_1` but
        are not necessarilly ordered.

        The value of `score` is between 0.0 and 1.0. The higher the score, the higher the similarity between
        the compared CLKs.

        #### Object Store Binary

        If the request includes the header `RETURN-OBJECT-STORE-ADDRESS`, the response will be a small json
        payload with temporary download credentials to pull the _binary_ similarity scores directly from the object
        store. The json object has `credentials` and `object` keys:

        ```json
        {
          "credentials": {
            "AccessKeyId": "",
            "SecretAccessKey": "",
            "SessionToken": "",
            "Expiration": "<ISO 8601 datetime string>"
          }
          "object": {
              "endpoint": "<config.DOWNLOAD_OBJECT_STORE_SERVER>",
              "secure": "<config.DOWNLOAD_OBJECT_STORE_SECURE>",
              "bucket": "bucket_name",
              "path": "path"
          }
        }
        ```

        The file itself is serialized using `anonlink.serialization`, you can convert the stream into Python types
        with:

        ```python
        mc = Minio(file_info['endpoint'], ...)
        candidate_pair_stream = mc.get_object(file_info['bucket'], file_info['path'])
        sims, (dset_is0, dset_is1), (rec_is0, rec_is1) = anonlink.serialization.load_candidate_pairs(candidate_pair_stream)
        ```

        ### result_type = "permutations"

        The data providers will receive their respective permutation:


            {
                "permutation": [3,0,4,1,2],
                "rows": 5
            }


        The creator of the mapping gets access to the mask:

            {
                "mask": [0,1,0,1,1]
            }


        In this example the first three elements in the original dataset are included,
        but have been reordered to the second, fourth and fifth positions. The other elements
        have been excluded with the mask. Note the permutation is specific to
        the caller. Also any data after row 5 is to be discarded after the reordering has
        been applied.
        The mask is an array of 0/1 numbers.

        ### result_type = "groups"

        A list of groups of records, where each group represents one entity. A record is a
        2-tuple of the dataset index and record index within that dataset.

        For example:
        {"groups": [[[0, 6], [1, 3], [3, 1]],
                    [[0, 8], [2, 6]],
                    [[0, 3], [3, 4]]]}

        Here, we have three groups. The first group contains three records and the other two
        groups each contain two records.

        In the first group, [0, 6] is the 7th record of the 1st dataset (because we're using)
        0-indexing. A particular record will appear in at most one group.

        In this example, there are many records that are not matched to any other records (for
        example [0, 5]). These trivial groups are omitted.
